# Speech Synthesis - Day 23 of JavaScript30

This repository is part of the JavaScript30 challenge by Wes Bos, specifically focusing on Day 23 - Speech Synthesis. The challenge involves creating a speech synthesis application using JavaScript.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a web application that utilizes the Speech Synthesis API to convert text input into speech. Users can type a message into an input field, choose a voice and rate of speech, and then hear the text spoken out loud using the selected voice and settings.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Speech Synthesis API

## Project Structure

The project structure is simple and consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the application, including input fields and buttons.
- `style.css`: Defines the styles and layout for the application.
- `script.js`: Implements the JavaScript functionality to interact with the Speech Synthesis API and handle user input.

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/speech-synthesis-day-23.git
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser.

2. Enter the text you want to be spoken into the input field.

3. Choose a voice from the dropdown menu.

4. Adjust the rate slider to set the speed of speech.

5. Click the "Speak" button to hear the text spoken with the chosen settings.
